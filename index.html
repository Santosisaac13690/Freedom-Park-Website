		<h3 class="testimonialtitle">About The Park</h3>
		<p id="text">Freedom Park is a park in Charlotte, North Carolina. Located at 1900 East Boulevard. The park is centered
			on a lake, and is about 3 miles from the heart of Charlotte's downtown area. The park has paved trails, tennis/volleyball
			courts, sport/athletic fields and playground equipment. The park contains a steam engine that is fenced and has safety
			bars added over the tender, but one can walk into the cab. In earlier years the train was open and kids could climb on
			top of it and under it.</p>
